Nauraa slowly turns toward me, responding to my thought with a soft growl. I open one eye and smile at him, sticking out my tongue teasingly. He moves his position, turns his back on me and pretends to sulk. He can be so sensitive sometimes. He lies down all stretched out with his muzzle between his front paws. Ah, it's siesta time… And we need it, he and I. It's hard to believe we were fighting to get out of this swamp just a few hours ago.\n\nI look at Nauraa's red fur and the scabs of coagulated blood on it, which now serve as badges of the harsh ordeals he's had to endure. By meeting here, we have turned this place into a beautiful if short-lived paradise. Around us, silvery dragonflies thrum between the reeds, little water spiders skate nonchalantly across the pond surface... If the Tumult were to blow through here again before the Expeditionary Corps arrives, everything we've stabilized would be destroyed and thrown into chaos.
